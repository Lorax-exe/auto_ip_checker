# AUTOMATIC VT CHECKER
Program that automates the checking of IPs with VT (it's meant for IPs but you can do wathever, might update later on)


## ipcheckjson.py
This one takes the CSV with the list of IPs as an argument and then outputs a JSON, you just need to put there your API key


## daje.py
Does the same thing, just using a GUI, it does also display which ones are harmful and whichones aren't, it's not pretty but works (you have to put in your API key before using it)
